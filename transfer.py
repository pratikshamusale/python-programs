#Break Statement
#In Python, the break statement provides you with the opportunity to exit out of
# a loop when an external condition is triggered.
# Youâ€™ll put the break statement within the block of code under your loop statement,
# usually after a conditional if statement.

# number = 0
#
# for number in range(10):
#     if number == 5:
#         break    # break here
#
#     print('Number is ' + str(number))
#
# print('Out of loop')

#Continue Statement
# The continue statement gives you the option to skip over the part of
# a loop where an external condition is triggered,
# but to go on to complete the rest of the loop. That is,
# the current iteration of the loop will be disrupted,
# but the program will return to the top of the loop.

# number = 0
#
# for number in range(10):
#     if number == 5:
#         continue    # continue here
#
#     print('Number is ' + str(number))
#
# print('Out of loop')

#pass Statement
#When an external condition is triggered,
# the pass statement allows you to handle the condition without the
# loop being impacted in any way; all of the code will continue to be read unless a
# break or other statement occurs.


# number = 0
#
# for number in range(10):
#     if number == 5:
#         pass    # pass here
#
#     print('Number is ' + str(number))
#
# print('Out of loop')
